# TheBetterPhoneBook
An android studio project I did in Poly for the Mobile App Development module

## Problem Statement
Mobile devices pose a significant challenge for the elderly demographic due to their potential for user confusion and usability issues.

Typically, elderly individuals tend to familiarize themselves with only the fundamental features of mobile devices, such as using the 'Contacts' app for making phone calls. 

Consequently, my goal is to enhance the 'Contacts' application by integrating advanced functionalities, allowing seniors to conveniently store and access a broader range of contact-related information within the app. This effort aims to ensure that the user experience remains intuitive and effective, without overwhelming them or exceeding their capacity for learning.

## Features
1) Save Contacts (Name, Phone Number, Address)
2) Call function
3) Search function for a specific contact
4) Saving of locations and viewing them in the google map API (save friend's home address or own home address)
5) Take photo to save as contact display photo
6) Link to website for app assistance
